# Vehicle Rental System

This is a simple OOP-based vehicle rental system in Java. It demonstrates:
- Abstract classes
- Interfaces
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance
- Real-world domain modeling

## Project Structure

- `Vehicle.java`: Base abstract class for all vehicles.
- `Rentable.java`: Interface for rental behavior.
- `Car`, `Bike`, `Truck`: Vehicle types.
- `RentalService.java`: Handles vehicle rental logic.
- `Main.java`: Demonstrates usage.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo.
2. Compile all Java files:

```bash
javac src/com/rental/*.java
